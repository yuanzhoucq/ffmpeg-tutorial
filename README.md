FFmpeg-Tutorial
===============

Compilation setup tested on macOS Catalina. 

To build all the tutorials, `CMake` and `SDL` are required.


    * * *
    The [original tutorials](http://dranger.com/ffmpeg/) have now been [updated](https://ffmpeg.org/pipermail/libav-user/2015-February/007896.html).
    I won't be maintaining this project anymore, and am keeping it here for historical reasons.
    * * *
    
    This repository contains files from an FFmpeg tutorial originally written by
    Stephen Dranger (dranger@gmail.com).  The files have been updated to work with
    the most recent version of FFmpeg (see VERSION.txt for the most recent version 
    at the time of writing).
    The updates were performed with an effort to modify as little code as possible,
    so that the original code and tutorial descriptions could be easily consulted.
    
    The code from the original tutorial and the accompanying description is located
    [here](http://dranger.com/ffmpeg/).
    
    Main changes
    ------------
    
    * Renamed includes, e.g. ffmpeg/avcodec.h --> libavcodec/avcodec.h
    * Work around deprecated functions and symbols (see below)
    * Initializing pointers to NULL on declaration.  Some FFmpeg functions
      (e.g. avformat\_open\_input) now segfault when given uninitialized pointers as
      input.
    * Removed tutorial08.c, which introduced software scaling (as
      opposed to using the img\_convert method).  img\_convert has been deprecated
      and is no longer available, so these new tutorials use software scaling
      from the very beginning, and a separate tutorial is not necessary.
    
    Deprecated Functions and Symbols
    --------------------------------
    
    This section describes the changes made to work around deprecated functions
    and symbols, in the format: before --> after.  In some cases, a simple rename
    sufficed (e.g. dump\_format), but in others, more significant changes to the
    code were required (e.g. avcodec\_decode\_audio2).  Consult the diffs for each
    respective tutorial to see exactly what has changed since the original 
    version of the tutorial.
    
    * av\_open\_input\_file --> avformat\_open\_input
    * av\_find\_stream\_info --> avformat\_find\_stream\_info
    * dump\_format --> av\_dump\_format
    * CODEC\_TYPE\_VIDEO --> AVMEDIA\_TYPE\_VIDEO
    * avcodec\_open --> avcodec\_open2
    * avcodec\_decode\_video --> avcodec\_decode\_video2
    * img\_convert --> sws\_scale
    * av\_close\_input\_file --> avformat\_close\_input
    * avcodec\_decode\_audio2 --> avcodec\_decode\_audio4
    * CODEC\_TYPE\_AUDIO --> AVMEDIA\_TYPE\_AUDIO
    * url\_set\_interrupt\_cb --> avio\_open2
    * url\_ferror --> check attribute is->pFormatCtx->pb->error
    * pstrcpy --> av\_strlcpy
    
    Building and Running
    --------------------
    
    First, make sure you have a recent installation of FFmpeg.  It's recommended
    that you build FFmpeg from source as described in 
    [this link](https://ffmpeg.org/trac/ffmpeg/wiki/UbuntuCompilationGuide).
    
    To build the tutorials:
    
        git clone git@github.com:chelyaev/ffmpeg-tutorial.git
        cd ffmpeg-tutorial
        make
    
    To run a tutorial, first make sure that your ffmpeg installation is on your
    $LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH and then:
    
        bin/tutorial01.out
